# IfYouAreBeingNosey
One of my biggest pet peeves is social media: the reason I deleted my Facebook account eons ago. I also keep my Linkedin in ultra-private mode. People leave your life for a reason. I just do not have the time or the desire to keep up with expired friendships and/or relationships.

If you have met me and you want to hang out with or see me again, have the maturity and/or social skills to solicit me for my contact information.

I certainly ask people I like for phone numbers or an email before parting ways.


Do you get the feeling that I am blowing you off: not calling or returning calls and the sneaking suspicion I have an email filter that sends anything with your name on it to the trash? There is a 99.99% chance you are right. I am just following the unwritten rules of yuppie socializing.

I follow the common sense rule: initiate contact twice -> no response -> hint taken.

I have been experiencing a lot of closure lately. The key principle I have learned over the years is: "Always go to far, that is where you will find the truth." 

If you have enough time to Google my name and snoop around my GitHub account, then you better be prepared for my unfiltered opinion(s). If you have EVER disrespected me and spoken down to me off your high horse -- you are dead to me. This includes ALL of my siblings and both of my parents. Life is too short and blood is not thicker than water: no further contact is desired.
