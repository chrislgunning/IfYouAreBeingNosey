# IfYouAreBeingNosey
One of my biggest pet peeves is social media: the reason I deleted my Facebook account eons ago. I also keep my Linkedin in ultra-private mode. People leave your life for a reason. I just do not have the time or the desire to keep up with expired friendships and/or relationships.

If you have met me and you want to hang out with or see me again, have the maturity and/or social skills to solicit me for my contact information.

I certainly ask people I like for phone numbers or an email before parting ways.


Do you get the feeling that I am blowing you off: not calling or returning calls and the sneaking suspicion I have an email filter that sends anything with your name on it to the trash? There is a 99.99% chance you are right. I am just following the unwritten rules of yuppie socializing.

I follow the common sense rule: initiate contact twice -> no response -> hint taken.
